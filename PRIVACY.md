This Chrome extension, SQL Formatter & Beautifier, does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data.

Data entered in the extension (such as SQL queries) is processed locally in the user’s browser. No information is sent to external servers.

The extension uses Chrome’s local storage API only to save user preferences, such as indentation, capitalization style, and formatting options. These settings remain private and local to the user’s device.

If the extension uses an external SQL formatting library (loaded from a CDN), that code runs only for the purpose of syntax highlighting and formatting. No data is shared or tracked by the library provider.

By using this extension, you agree that no personal or sensitive data will be collected, stored, or transmitted at any time.
